# Tools for TAOCP programs

[**`texttobinary.sh:`**](texttobinary.sh) Converts a list of numbers to binary data. Many MMIX programs and their equivalents in C only take binary input since MMIX has no builtin library for string processing. This tool allows convenient readable data to be used with these programs.

[**`table_5.5.1_n_1000.mmix.sh:`**](table_5.5.1_n_1000.mmix.sh) Generates data used for N=1000 column in Table 1 of section 5.5 of The MMIX Supplement for TAOCP Vol 3
