# Tools for TAOCP programs

[**`texttobinary.sh:`**](texttobinary.sh) Converts a list of numbers to binary data. Many MMIX programs and their equivalents in C only take binary input since MMIX has no builtin library for string processing. This tool allows convenient readable data to be used with these programs.

[**`gendata.sh:`**](gendata.sh) Generates data used for N=1000 column in Table 1 of section 5.5 of TAOCP Vol 3. Two versions of the dataset are available - the one used in the original TAOCP table and the one used in the updated table from The MMIX Supplement.
