Algorithms and programs from The Art of Computer Programming written in C

This is a collection of C programs for material from TAOCP. The goal is to provide aids to facilitate the understanding of content from TAOCP. To this end, the C code tries to mirror the structure and notation of the algorithms described in TAOCP without overly sacrificing high-level language constructs. For example, if an algorithm uses an array indexed from 1, so does the C program. Also any input and output of a C program should be compatible with the equivalent MMIX program should there be one. For example, if the MMIX program for an algorithm reads and writes binary data in bigendian format, so does the C program.

Code is not limited to just implementing the named algorithms in TAOCP. Exercise solutions or MMIX programs without algorithms are also fair candidates for versions in C.
